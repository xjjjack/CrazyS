CrazyS
===============

| CrazyS build status | [![Build Status](https://github.com/gsilano/CrazyS/actions/workflows/melodic.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gsilano/CrazyS/actions/workflows/melodic.yml) | [![Build Status](https://github.com/gsilano/CrazyS/actions/workflows/noetic.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gsilano/CrazyS/actions/workflows/noetic.yml)
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  

CrazyS is an extension of the ROS package [RotorS](https://github.com/ethz-asl/rotors_simulator), aimed to modeling, developing and integrating the [Crazyflie 2.0](https://www.bitcraze.io/crazyflie-2/) nano-quadcopter in the physics based simulation environment Gazebo. The contribution can be also considered as a reference guide for expanding the RotorS functionalities in the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) field, by facilitating the integration of new aircraft.

Such simulation platform allows to understand quickly the behavior of the flight control system by comparing and evaluating different indoor and outdoor scenarios, with a details level quite close to reality. The proposed extension expands RotorS capabilities by considering the Crazyflie 2.0 physical model and its flight control system, as well (the [2018.01.1](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-firmware/releases/tag/2018.01.1) firmware release).

A simple case study is considered (`crazyflie2_hovering_example.launch`) in order to show how the package works and the validity of the employed dynamical model together the control architecture of the quadrotor. The code is released under Apache license, thus making it available for scientific and educational activities.

The platform was developed using Ubuntu 16.04 and the Kinetic Kame version of ROS, but it is also fully compatible with Ubuntu 18.04 along with the Melodic Morenia distribution of ROS and Ubuntu 20.0.4 along with the Noetic Ninjemys release. Although backwards compatibility is guarantee, i.e., the platform is fully compatible with Indigo Igloo version of ROS and Ubuntu 14.04, such configuration is not recommended since the ROS support is expected to be closed in April 2019.

Below we provide the instructions necessary for getting started. See [CrazyS' wiki](https://github.com/gsilano/CrazyS/wiki) for more instructions and examples.

This guide can be used a basis for fixing what has been discussed in [ethz-asl/rotors_simulator#506](https://github.com/ethz-asl/rotors_simulator/pull/506).

Installation Instructions - Ubuntu 14.04 with ROS Indigo
--------------------------------------------------------

 1. Install and initialize ROS indigo desktop full, additional ROS packages, catkin-tools, and wstool:

```console
$ sudo sh -c ’echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list’
$ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://ha.pool.skskeyservers.net:80 --recv-key 421C365BD9FF1F717815A3895523BAEEB01FA116
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-desktop-full ros-indigo-joy
$ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-octomap-ros python-wstool python-catkin-tools
$ sudo apt-get install protobuf compiler libgoogle-glog-dev
$ sudo rosdep init
$ rosdep update
$ echo "source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
$ sudo apt-get install python-rosinstall
```

2. If you don't have ROS workspace yet you can do so by

```console
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ catkin_init_workspace  # initialize your catkin workspace
$ catkin init
```
> **Note** for setups with multiple workspaces please refer to the [official documentation](http://docs.ros.org/independent/api/rosinstall/html/) by replacing `rosws` by `wstool`.

 3. Get the simulator and additional dependencies

```console
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/gsilano/CrazyS.git
$ git clone -b crazys https://github.com/gsilano/mav_comm.git
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ rosdep install --from-paths src -i
```

> **Note** On OS X you need to install yaml-cpp using Homebrew `brew install yaml-cpp`.

> **Note** if you want to use `wstool` you can replace the above commands with
    ```console
    wstool set --git local_repo_name git@github.com:organization/repo_name.git
    ```
> **Note** if you want to build and use the `gazebo_mavlink_interface` plugin you have to get MAVROS as an additional dependency from link below. Follow the installation instructions provided there and build all of its packages prior to building the rest of your workspace.
    ```
    https://github.com/mavlink/mavros
    ```
 4. Build your workspace with `python_catkin_tools` (therefore you need `python_catkin_tools`)

```console
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/
$ catkin init  # If you haven't done this before.
$ catkin build
```
 > **Note** if you are getting errors related to "future" package, you may need python future:
    ```console
    sudo apt-get install python-pip
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install future
    ```

 5. Add sourcing to your `.bashrc` file

```console
$ echo "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

Basic Usage
-----------

Launching the simulation is quite simple, so as customizing it: it is enough to run in a terminal the command

```console
$ roslaunch rotors_gazebo crazyflie2_hovering_example.launch
```

> **Note** The first run of gazebo might take considerably long, as it will download some models from an online database. To avoid any problems when starting the simulation for the first time, you may run the `gazebo` command in the terminal line.

By default the state estimator is disabled since on-board Crazyflie's sensors are replaced by the odometry one. For running the simulation by taking into account the Crazyflie's IMU and the complementary filter, it is enough to give a command that turns on the flag `enable state estimator`:

```console
$ roslaunch rotors_gazebo crazyflie2_hovering_example.launch enable_state_estimator:=true
```

The visual outcome will see the nano-quadcopter taking off after 5s (time after which the hovering example node publishes the trajectory to follow) and flying one meter above the ground, at the same time keeping near to zero the position components along x and y-axis.

The whole process is the following: the desired trajectory coordinates (x_r, y_r, z_r and \psi_r) are published by the `hovering_example` node on the topic `command/trajectory`, to whom the `position_controller` node (i.e., the Crazyflie controller) is subscribed. The drone state (`odometry_sensor1/odometry` topic) and the references are used to run the control strategy designed for the position tracking. The outputs of the control algorithm consist into the actuation commands (\omega_1, \omega_2, \omega_3 and \omega_4) sent to Gazebo (`command/motor_speed`) for the physical simulation and the corresponding graphical rendering, so to visually update the aircraft position and orientation. When the state estimator is turned off, the drone orientation (\phi_k, \theta_k and \psi_k) and angular velocities (p_k, q_k and r_k) published on the topic odometry are replaced by the ideal values coming from the odometry sensor.

There are some basic launch files where you can load the different multicopters with additional sensors. They can all be found in `~/catkin_ws/src/CrazyS/rotors_gazebo/launch`. Such scenarios are better explained in the [RotorS](https://github.com/ethz-asl/rotors_simulator) repository.

The `world_name` argument looks for a `.world` file with a corresponding name in `~/catkin_ws/src/CrazyS/rotors_gazebo/worlds`. By default, all launch files, with the exception of those that have the world name explicitly included in the file name, use the empty world described in `basic.world`.

Using the `csvFilesStoring` variable is possible to enable (true) or disable (false) the data storage. The log files are saved in the home directory (the path can be easily changed modifying the `position_controller.cpp` file). The recording time can be set via the `csvFilesStoringTime` while the user account can be set via the `user_account` variable. Of course, the log features can be used with and without the complementary filter.

```console
$ roslaunch rotors_gazebo crazyflie2_hovering_example.launch csvFilesStoring:=true
```

An alternative controller is available on the repository. For running the simulation by using the Internal Model Control as described in [#27](https://github.com/gsilano/CrazyS/issues/27), [#28](https://github.com/gsilano/CrazyS/issues/28), [#29](https://github.com/gsilano/CrazyS/issues/29), and [#48](https://github.com/gsilano/CrazyS/issues/48) simply run

```console
$ roslaunch rotors_gazebo crazyflie2_internal_model_controller.launch
```

or

```console
$ roslaunch rotors_gazebo crazyflie2_internal_model_controller_vi_sensor.launch
```

while a simple swarm example is available at

```console
$ roslaunch rotors_gazebo crazyflie2_swarm_hovering_example.launch
```

> **Note** There is also a draft of the Mellinger's controller implementation in the package. This is a NOT WORKING example. As soon as the problems are resolved, a working version will be made available.

The package also provides a launch file for piloting the Crazyflie using a PC joystick. To run the simulation simple copy and paste the command in the following in a terminal window

```console
$ roslaunch rotors_gazebo crazyflie2_with_joy.launch
```

> **Note** As explained in [#90](https://github.com/gsilano/CrazyS/issues/90), the recent updates in the xacro file format may break the simulation. To avoid these issue, simply downgrade the version of `xacro` to the 1.13.3 version. Remove `xacro` and `xacro-1.14.11.egg-info` directories from `/opt/ros/noetic/lib/python3/dist-packages` folder using `sudo rm -r ...` command and install the 1.13.3 version of xacro using `pip3 install xacro==1.13.3`. This avoid further modifications to the launch files.

Gazebo Version
--------------

At a minimum, Gazebo `v2.x` is required (which is installed by default with ROS Indigo). However, it is **recommended to install at least Gazebo `v5.x`** for full functionality, although the platform is fully compatible with the Gazebo 9. Before running the script, consider the following limitations:

1. `iris.sdf` can only be generated with Gazebo >= `v3.0`, as it requires use of the `gz sdf ...` tool. If this requirement is not met, you will not be able to use the Iris MAV in any of the simulations.
2. The Gazebo plugins `GazeboGeotaggedImagesPlugin`, `LidarPlugin` and the `LiftDragPlugin` all require Gazebo >= `v5.0`, and will not be built if this requirement is not met.
